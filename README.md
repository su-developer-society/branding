# Branding
Where resources for the branding of the society are stored.

The goal of this repository is not only to store the logo or branding images
used by the society, but also to store the tools used by members of the society
to create the branding for the society so that future members can easily
maintain and modify the society branding.

Currently, there exists a tool to create the logo for the developer society in
`./logo_maker/`.
